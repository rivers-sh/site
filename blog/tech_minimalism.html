                <p>lets get one thing straight: tech minimalism does <em>NOT</em> mean being tech illiterate. tech minimalism is simply:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>cutting out the noise (social media, time wasting apps)</li>
                    <li>using technology with intentionality (enhance productivity)</li>
                    <li>focusing on quality over quantity (focusing on what matters)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>so, what can i do to convince you to practice this? well, nothing; it's much easier to over-indulge than to practice discipline and mindfulness. <em>BUT</em>, for those that are interested in practicing tech minimalism, i'll leave some advice below: </p> 
                <p>firstly, you should dump your smartphone and switch to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dumbphones/" target="blank">dumbphone</a>, however, i realize the average person can't afford to just buy a new phone on a whim. a good alternative, is switching your phone to <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/how-to-set-your-iphone-or-android-phone-to-black-and-white-and-why-its-a-fun-experiement/" target="blank">grayscale mode</a>.</p>

                <p> second, uninstall every social media app you have (<em>i'm not telling you to quit social media</em>) and only use them on your desktop or laptop- this will stop you from habitually pulling out your phone</p>

                <p>lastly, if you still find yourself addicted to your phone, assign parental controls, and have one of your friends set up the password without telling you <em>(this should be a last measure)</em></p>
