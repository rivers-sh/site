                <p>a quick google search on "before getting into linux, it's important to understand what linux <em>is</em></p>

                <p>firstly, linux is <em>NOT </em>an operating system, linux is the thing underneath the operating system (a kernel). but, when someone says "i run linux", they're talking about a linux distro</p> 
                
                <p>some quick info on what a distro is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the operating system of your computer</li>
                    <li>there are hundreds of distros, each tailored to different needs</li>
                    <li>many distros are based off other distros, think of them as "forks"</li>
                </ul>
                <p>if you want to jump right in, the best beginner friendly distro is <a href="https://linuxmint.com" target="blank">linux mint. </a>alternatively, if you're looking for something more specific to your needs, there's a subreddit called <a href="https://reddit.com/r/findmealinuxdistro" target="blank">r/findmealinuxdistro</a></p>
